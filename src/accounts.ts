/**
 * The account selector (story 009 R6, from story 005's preserved D1/D2/D4/D8):
 * the declared-account list, the `select` config option built from it, and the
 * one environment overlay a selection resolves to.
 *
 * Kept self-contained — nothing here imports `acp-agent.ts`; what the module
 * needs from the adapter (the resolved settings object, a logger) is injected
 * instead, which also leaves the logic unit-testable in isolation. Same reason
 * as `thinking-option.ts` and `account-usage.ts`: `acp-agent.ts` is a ~9,900
 * line file that changes upstream almost daily, so every coupling to it is paid
 * again at each sync. `acp-agent.ts` wires these helpers into
 * `buildConfigOptions`, `applyConfigOptionValue` and query creation.
 *
 * Two notions this module never conflates (D3):
 *   - the ADAPTER's configuration home is `acp-agent.ts`'s module-level
 *     `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, computed once from the process environment. A switch
 *     does NOT move it — if it did, the adapter would begin reading its own
 *     `settings.json` out of the switched account's directory, silently and
 *     only for the readers that ran after the switch;
 *   - the SESSION's account home is the overlay {@link envForAccount} builds,
 *     handed to the SDK per session (`Options.env`, `sdk.d.ts:1525`) and to
 *     nothing else. No Zed patch is involved: the client already renders any
 *     config option the adapter advertises.
 *
 * NO FILE IS OPENED HERE, and no directory is scanned. Accounts are DECLARED,
 * never discovered (D4): this reads a list someone wrote down. What it puts on
 * the wire is display names — the configuration directory is what points at the
 * credentials, so it stays on this side of the protocol (R6.4).
