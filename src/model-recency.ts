/**
 * Picker recency filter: show only the newest model of each family.
 *
 * The SDK catalogue carries every model the account may reach, superseded ones
 * included — measured 2026-09-23 it returned eleven rows, of which six were
 * older Opus/Fable/Sonnet generations (`claude-opus-4-6` … `claude-fable-5`).
 * This module keeps the newest of each family and drops the rest, so the picker
 * offers one current choice per family instead of a version history.
 *
 * **Why a RULE and not a list.** That catalogue is served by the backend, not
 * baked into the pinned CLI, and it was measured changing twice in one day under
 * a fixed build — five rows, then eleven, with different titles and taglines. A
 * hardcoded set of "current" ids would therefore be stale within hours, and
 * silently: nothing fails when a picker row is wrong, the user simply gets the
 * wrong model. Ranking by parsed version means the next launch promotes itself
 * and retires its predecessor with no edit here.
 *
 * **Total and fail-open.** Anything this cannot place — an alias with no
 * `resolvedModel`, a third-party id, a naming scheme that changes — is KEPT.
 * Hiding a model the user has is worse than showing one row too many, and a
 * parser is exactly the kind of thing a vendor breaks without warning. For the
 * same reason the caller falls back to the unfiltered list if this would empty
 * it.
 *
 * Composed with the deprecation heuristic in `model-deprecation.ts`: that one
 * reads prose, this one reads versions, and neither can do the other's job.
