/**
 * Context compaction as ONE idempotent ACP tool lifecycle (story 010, R2.1/R2.2).
 *
 * What this replaces: the adapter used to infer compaction from a
 * `compactionInProgress` boolean and narrate it as assistant text
 * ("Compacting…", "Compacting completed."). The flag existed only because, in
 * the adapter's own comment, the SDK's two terminal `status` messages were
 * "indistinguishable" — a guess, not a signal. Once the lifecycle is explicit
 * the guess is not merely redundant, it double-reports: the tool call says the
 * compaction finished and the banner says so again. So the inference is
 * DELETED, not left inert (D4) — a flag that no longer decides anything is a
 * thing the next reader has to prove is inert.
 *
 * What replaces it: a small state machine that folds every event shape the SDK
 * can produce onto a single tool call.
 *
 *   SDK event                                   → lifecycle call
 *   ------------------------------------------- -----------------------------
 *   `status` = "compacting"                     → start()      tool_call, in_progress
 *   `stream_event` compaction block/delta       → heartbeat()  tool_call_update, in_progress
 *   `status` with compact_result success/failed → finish()     tool_call_update, terminal
 *   `compact_boundary` (token counts)           → finish(enrich) tool_call_update, metadata only
 *   a terminal with no preceding "compacting"   → finish()     tool_call, terminal (standalone)
 *   a DUPLICATED terminal                       → finish()     nothing
 *
 * The two hard cases pull in opposite directions and both are real:
 *
 *   - The SDK duplicates the terminal `compact_result` message for a single
 *     failed compaction. Two terminals for one compaction must stay ONE report.
 *   - One model turn can legitimately compact more than once. Two genuine
 *     compactions must stay TWO distinguishable reports.
 *
 * The state machine separates them by phase rather than by identity: a
 * terminal that arrives when the lifecycle has already terminated is a
 * duplicate and changes nothing, while a fresh `compacting` status AFTER a
 * terminal opens a new lifecycle with a new tool call id. A rule that instead
 * suppressed by matching ids or payloads would satisfy one case by breaking
 * the other.
 *
 * State lives until the owning turn's `result` (or an abort) rather than being
 * cleared at each terminal, because the SDK can also omit the opening status
 * on replay — the terminal has to be able to stand alone.
 *
 * Kept self-contained — no import from `acp-agent.ts`, mirroring
 * `thinking-option.ts` and `rewind-command.ts`; what it needs from the adapter
 * (the send chokepoint) is injected, which also leaves the whole state machine
 * unit-testable without a live SDK session. The reason is merge cost:
 * `acp-agent.ts` is a ~9,700-line file that changes upstream almost daily, so
 * every coupling to it is paid again at each sync.
