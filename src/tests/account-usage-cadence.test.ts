/**
 * Story 002, sub-task 1.4 — when the structured usage report is asked for.
 *
 * Contract (R1.1, R1.2, R1.7, R1.8): the report is requested once when the
 * session is established, so the bars are born filled rather than waiting for a
 * push that may never come, and once again at the end of each turn, which is
 * when consumption actually changed.
 *
 * A third moment was added later: an idle refresh on a timer. The two borders
 * above are both *consumption* events, and none of them is *time* — so a window
 * that resets while nobody is prompting kept showing the old utilization until
 * somebody sent a prompt. The tick stands down while a turn is in flight (that
 * turn's own end already refreshes) and dies with the query stream. A failed request leaves the session
 * running and reports nothing, and the live `rate_limit_event` forwarding — the
 * only source of a MEASURED status — keeps working alongside the new one.
 *
 * The SDK method is `usage_EXPERIMENTAL_MAY_CHANGE_DO_NOT_RELY_ON_THIS_API_YET`
 * (sdk.d.ts). The name is deliberately awful and deliberately pinned here: it
 * is the only name the real `Query` answers to, and a rename must fail loudly
 * rather than degrade to no report at all.
